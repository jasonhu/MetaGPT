Here's the revised `main.py` based on the code review and actions outlined above. This version includes error handling, uses the `Game` class to manage the game loop, and adds a simple state to handle the display of messages.

```python
## main.py
import pygame
from pygame.locals import QUIT, KEYDOWN

from game import Game
from assets import get_message, get_congratulatory_message

## Initialize Constants
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
FPS = 60

## Main Program
def main():
    try:
        # Initialize Pygame and create a window
        pygame.init()
        screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
        pygame.display.set_caption("Hello, World! Game")
        
        # Initialize the Game object
        game = Game(screen)

        # Start the game
        game.start()

        # Main game loop
        running = True
        clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        while running:
            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == QUIT:
                    running = False
                elif event.type == KEYDOWN:  # Example of interaction: display congratulatory message on key press
                    game.display_message(get_congratulatory_message())
                    pygame.time.wait(1000)  # Wait for 1 second
                    running = False

            # Display the initial message or other game state messages
            game.run()  # This should handle the display of current game state messages

            # Update the display and tick the clock
            pygame.display.flip()
            clock.tick(FPS)

        # Clean up and quit the game
        pygame.quit()

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this version, the `main` function initializes Pygame and sets up the game window, then hands over control to the `Game` class to manage the game loop and state. The `start` and `run` methods of the `Game` class should be implemented in `game.py` to handle game initialization and the main game loop logic, respectively.

Please note that the `run` method should contain the logic for displaying the current game state's message, and the `start` method should set up any necessary game state variables. This refactor assumes that the `Game` class has been designed to manage game states and message displaying as per the original requirements.

Remember that this is just one part of the application, and the `Game` and `assets` classes should also be reviewed and refactored to ensure they are consistent with the overall design and functionality.
